            Hyper Light Drifter is an action role-playing game developed and published by Heart Machine.<br><br>The game pays homage to 8-bit and 16-bit games, and is considered by its lead developer Alx Preston as a combination of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Diablo.

        <p><!-- Paragraph -->
            Preston originally launched Kickstarter funding for the title for approximately US$27,000 to develop the title for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux computers, but ended up with more than US$600,000, allowing him to hire more programmers and artists, and expanding the title for console and portable platforms through stretch goals. Though originally scoped for release in 2014, various improvements in the game and issues with Preston's health set the release back.

        <h2>Story</h2> <!-- Heading 2 for Story section -->
        <p><!-- Paragraph -->
            The Drifter is a Blu who arrives in the Land of Light, a complete stranger to the new continent, having traveled from the Northern Realms continent to the northwest in a boat and crashed it on the northwestern shore not far from the central town, presumably to find a cure to his debilitation, following the Anubis-like Jackal in hopes that they will lead him to an answer. On his way there, he fights through a small gauntlet of enemies, where he picks up a pistol and immediately puts it to use. As he exits the dungeon and approaches the Library, he falls into a coughing fit, and is confronted by an entity referred to as "Judgement", who strikes him down. At some point he is found and nursed back to health by the Guardian, and wakes up in their house, picking up a map and learning how to access Immortal Cell. From there, he fights his way through the 4 corners of the Land of Light, activating the 4 obelisks and opening up the ground beneath central town and revealing the path to Judgment. After an intense battle, the Drifter finishes Judgment, and destroys the Immortal Cell. As the cavern collapses around him, Anubis abandons the Drifter, leaving him to drift away in peace one final time.
